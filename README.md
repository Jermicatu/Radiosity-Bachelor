# Radiosity-Bachelor

Bachelor Thesis by Julius dos Santos Costa about 3D Simulation using Radiosity.
29.11.2022

This is the program created parallel to the Bachelor Thesis "Radiosity".
It can bu used alone but is better understood when used after reading the Thesis. The chapters 5 and 6 are especially important as the former goes over important functions in the program and the later shows some interesting scenes.


In order to run the program one needs to install any version equal or higher than 2020b of Matlab at https://matlab.mathworks.com/ and put the files in the MATLAB directory so that the program can access them.
After that just run the tester.m file and it should produce a picture of the base scene as mentioned in the Thesis.

Thank you for using this Simulation :)
